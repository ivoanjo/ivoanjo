#### `Sup?`

`my name is Ivo Anjo, and i'm a software engineer @ aws`

`i keep my personal repositories `[`on gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/ivoanjo)` instead of here, although I'll admit that the readme-in-profile functionality is rather neat and i've upvoted the feature request to `[`get it on gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232157).

`some of my repositories over there are:`

* [`persistent-ðŸ’Ž`](https://gitlab.com/ivoanjo/persistent-dmnd)` a ruby library for persistent/immutable data structures`

* [`pry-debugger-jruby`](https://gitlab.com/ivoanjo/pry-debugger-jruby)` a library to enable interactive debugging when using `[`pry`](https://pry.github.io/)` on `[`jruby`](https://www.jruby.org/)

* [`videos and slides for my conference and meetup talks`](https://gitlab.com/ivoanjo/talks)

`if you've made it this far, you may also enjoy my blog which you can find at `[`ivoanjo.me`](https://ivoanjo.me)
